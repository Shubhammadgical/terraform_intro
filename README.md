# An Introduction to Terraform

This article would guide us about Introduction of terraform. We shall discuss the following:

1. Deploy a single server
2. Deploy a single web server
3. Deploy a configurable web server
4. Deploy a cluster of web servers
5. Deploy a load balancer
6. Clean up

I took inspiration from this [article](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180#a9b0) and you should first read this blog to understand the steps properly. and the code explained in this [video part-1](https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/kapil_jain/Ef0H3oWHQyBMiocS2O9rVRsBm3RQpxwZBmJD-AlXmZsmnA?e=zO9UJ9) and [video part-2](https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/kapil_jain/EY7NTuItyotJlQpC_KdtEqgBT7I-A9fQF38hKiqzxZzOsA?e=kVkQBF)

# Installing / Getting started

Install Terraform [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn6xYf0QJME)

Setup your AWS account [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA9pl-A9gDM)

create IAM user with progammatic access and administrator Access [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx_-IA9qnuI)

# Steps to run the code after we configure AWS account and Terraform on our machine.

1. Run terraform init command. It initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

```
terraform init
```

2. Run terraform plan command. It creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.

```
terraform plan
```

3. Run terraform graph command(show you the dependency graph)

```
terraform graph
```

4. Run terraform apply command. I perform the plan.

```
terraform apply
```

5. Run curl <alb_dns_name> (After running terraform apply you got a url in alb_dns_name outputs. Example: curl terraform-asg-example-1288647294.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com).

6. Run terraform destroy command

```
terraform destroy
```

# For Deploy

Remove code from line no. 7 to 14 and from line no. 20 to 151.

## Deploy a single server

1. Run below commands:
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   terraform destroy

## Deploy a single web server

1. Add below code at the same line in main.tf.

2. Run below commands:
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply (Go to your aws instance and youâ€™ll see your new EC2 Instance deploying. Click your new Instance, copy its public IP address in the description panel at the bottom of the screen. Give the Instance a minute or two to boot up, and then use a web browser or a tool like curl to make an HTTP request to this IP address at port 8080:)
   curl http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
   terraform destroy

## Deploy a configurable web server

1. Add below code at the same line in main.tf.

2. Run below commands:
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   terraform destroy

## Deploy a cluster of web servers

1. Add below code at the same line in main.tf.

2. Run below commands:
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   terraform destroy

## Deploy a load balancer

1. Add below code at the same line in main.tf.

2. Run below commands:
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply (After running terraform apply you got a url in alb_dns_name outputs.)
   Run curl http://<alb_dns_name>
   terraform destroy
